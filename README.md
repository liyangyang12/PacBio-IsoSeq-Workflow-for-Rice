Here you can find the corresponding analysis scripts for our publication "De novo reconstruction of transcriptomes of ten Oryza sativa cultivars using PacBio Single-Molecule Real-Time sequencing" (doi: XXX).

It inlcudes the bash scripts for the PacBio IsoSeq3 pipeline and the blast command as well as different scripts for the visualization of the BUSCO plots. Additionally, the script for the differential gene expression analysis using DESeq2 is available.
